# 为什么使用微服务架构
Tremendous patterns and architectures have been explored with some gaining popularity;
there are others, though, that are losing the battle of internet traffic. With each solution having its own advantages and disadvantages, it has become increasingly important for companies to quickly respond to fundamental demands, such as scalability, high performance, and easy deployment. Any single aspect failing to be fulfilled in a cost-effective manner could easily impact large businesses negatively, making a big difference between a profitable and non-profitable venture.
This is where we see microservices coming to the rescue of enterprise system architects. They can ensure their designs against problems mentioned previously, with the help of this architectural style. It is also important to consider the fact that this objective is met in a cost-effective manner while respecting the time involved.
`注：感觉这些都是废话，所以没有翻译。作为架构师，面对当前的软件行业客户需求，面对采用老技术的各种瓶颈，使用服务化的软件构成方式是不二选择，除非你能创造出比小服务化更高的性能、更高的扩展性、更低的开发成本、更快的部署的架构风格来！`
